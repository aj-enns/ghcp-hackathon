## Instructions

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Shift+I`)
2. Click the 📎 **attachment button** in the chat input
3. Select **any code file you've generated** during the hackathon
4. Copy the prompt below and paste it into Copilot Chat
5. Press Enter and watch Copilot find vulnerabilities!

## Prompt

Perform an OWASP Top 10 security analysis on this code:

1. Identify potential vulnerabilities by category
2. Rate each finding by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Provide remediation code examples for each issue
4. Suggest security best practices for this type of application

## Follow-up Prompts

Try these after the initial response:

- "Generate security-focused unit tests for the identified vulnerabilities"
- "What security headers should be implemented?"
- "How would you implement input validation for all user inputs?"
- "Create a security checklist for code reviews"
- "What logging should be added for security monitoring?"
