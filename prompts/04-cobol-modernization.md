## Prompt

Analyze the attached COBOL code and:

1. Explain what this program does in plain English
2. Identify the data structures and business logic
3. Convert this to modern Python with equivalent functionality
4. Ensure the conversion maintains the same behavior

## Follow-up Prompts

Try these after the initial response:

- "Now convert the same logic to C# with proper OOP patterns"
- "Create a REST API wrapper around this functionality using FastAPI"
- "Generate unit tests that verify the conversion matches the original behavior"
- "What improvements would you suggest for the modernized version?"
- "How would you handle the file I/O in a cloud-native environment?"
